***AI Usage Documentation***


**Where AI helped:**
- AI helps me to set up the navigation structure with NavHost and sealed class for defining routes with parameters
- The Material 3 UI components like TopAppBar, BottomNavigationBar uses AI suggestions
- AI helped me implement the ViewModel pattern


**Where AI got confused:**
- AI suggested passing the entire Recipe object through navigation instead of using String/Int route parameters like recipe_detail/{recipeId}
- The conditional back button in TopAppBar confused AI which initially showed the back button on all screens
